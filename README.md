some common questions:
1. Is this an AI model? In what ways is it similar or dissimilar from AI models?

No, this SLM model is very basic compartively to the AI models present in the industry. however, it is quite similar to many AI models out there as AI currently in the industry is just predicitve modelling and works on large set of data. This SLM also works on a data set(very small compartively to the ChatGPT) and predicts the next words based on the last 2 words.

2. Could this model be useful for any real-world applications?

i have added a sample-1.txt in files. it is a txt file containing numbers 1 to 100. this model recognises the pattern very well and prints counting with 100% precision and not doing random stuff except the starting pair. This has a real world application of text prediction with good amount of precision on medium data sets.

3. what would be the next improvements or enhancements you would make to this model?

We would like to add english rules like using certain pronouns, verbs and adding them to the text whenever it feels that there should be one. for eg: adding 'The' infront of universal things and adding an infront of vowels etc. We can use Firebase or any other data saving tech so that the function can learn the pattern and use previously compiled programs to enhance the future ones.
